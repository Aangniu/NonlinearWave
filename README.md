# NonlinearWave
A collection of Jupyter notebooks that tests different nonlinear models based on FEniCS package.

- WaveProp1D-Veri.ipynb: The bone curve of MPII and try to verify the solution withe the Method of Manufactured Solutions

- WaveProp1D-MPII.ipynb: Full MPII model that considers multiple yielding surface

- WaveProp1D.ipynb: Only the bone curve of MPII model, more or less a non-linear elasticity model

- WaveProp2D-Real-Plas.ipynb: vonMises plasticity with strain hardening
